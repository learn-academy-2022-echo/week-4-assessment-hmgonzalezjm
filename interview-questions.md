# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: The idea behind OOP is to make programing a bit easier using classes and objects. Functional programming uses pure functions than cant be modified

Researched answer: Object Oriented programming is a type of programing that uses objects to represent data that you are programming. An example would be a data structure which holds data about the object called attributes. The attributes in a object are iterated through functions or methods that are then directed to the object. The idea of Functional programming is to try and avoid changing state and data. The output of the function should always be the same because it relies on taking in an argument.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: Intergers are represented by whole numbers while a float is used to return numbers are not whole and typically contain a decimal.

Researched answer: When using Ruby for real-world applications the float data type is typically used because it will provide more accurate values. Intergers only provide whole numbers where as float will return precise values which is important when working with calculations

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Simply put if a return is inputed last then a return keyword is not needed

Researched answer: When using Ruby the block will automatically return the value of the last line. If you want to take a minimalistic approach to your code then it is common to leave the return keyword out since it is implied.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: Blocks allow for code to be reused

Researched answer: Blocks can be considered an anonymous function that returns a value applied to the method that calls it. Blocks are contained in def/end and are useful because you can share logic instead of having to make a new function.

5. What is an instance variable in Ruby?

Your answer: Its part of OOP and is a type of variable that starts with an @

Researched answer: An instance variable always starts with an @ symbol. The data inside the instance variable can only be tied to the object it is referenced in. Using Ruby, we can have two objects that belong in the same class and these objects are allowed to have different instance variable values.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system.

2. Ruby on Rails: Rails is a development tool which gives web developers a framework, providing structure for all the code they write. 

3. ORM: This is the Object Relation Manager and it means you don't have to manually call the database.

4. Active Record:  An active record allows you to validate the state of a model before it gets written into a database

5. Migrations: A migration allows you to describe, alter and organize your database in an organized way
